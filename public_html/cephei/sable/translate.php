The distance between the point of the Lower Looper and the Needle should be the thickness of the hook end of your Merrow Tweezers 37-225-C, or about 1/32 of an inch (.035). <a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Refer to diagram &#147;A&#148;</a> for bending the Lower Looper to this setting.</p> <p class="bodytext" align="left"><span class="smsubhead">D)</span> The top corner of the needlepoint (where the point meets the blade) should contact the Nneedle Guard of the Lower Looper with a little pressure (<a href="lowerlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">see diagram 2</a>). To gage this, turn the Hand Wheel to separate the Needle from the Lower Looper. Insert a small scrap piece of note-paper (this is approximately 3 thousandths of an inch thick) between the Needle and the Lower Looper. Turn the Hand Wheel back so that just the thickness of the paper is caught between the Needle and the Looper. You should be able to remove the paper, but you should feel a slight drag against it as you pull it out. <a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Refer to diagram &#147;B&#148;</a> for bending Lower Looper to this setting. </p> <p class="bodytext" align="left"><a href="lowerlooper.htm" class="default" target="_blank">Click Here for LOWER LOOPER SETTING DIAGRAMS</a></p> <p align="left"><span class="smsubhead">E)</span> <span class="bodytext">Turn the Hand Wheel slightly, until the point of the Lower Looper arrives behind the Needle. The point of the Lower Looper should contact the rear surface of the Needle, but it should not deflect the Needle (<a href="lowerlooper.htm" class="default" target="_blank">see diagram 3</a>). The note-paper gage used above, also works here. If you are using &#147;scarfed&#148; Needle, the point of the Lower Looper should still contact, but not deflect the Needle. Generally, a Lower Looper is set tighter to a &#147;scarfed&#148; Needle than a standard Needle. <a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Refer to diagram &#147;E&#148;</a> to adjust the point of the Lower Looper to the Needle.</span></p> <p align="left"><span class="smsubhead">F)</span><span class="bodytext"> Insert Upper Looper into the Upper Looper Carrier as far as it will go.

The Upper Looper should be far enough back that the Needle passes just behind the head. It should also be far enough forward that its point passes through the scarf, just behind the eye of the Lower Looper. Look for interference (contact) between the Upper Looper and Needle, or the Upper Looper and Lower Looper. The Upper Looper should not contact either the Needle or Lower Looper. If there is contact, adjust the Upper Looper to clear the one it is contacting. If it is contacting both, adjust the Upper Looper to clear the one with the most interference first.</span></p> <p align="left"><span class="smsubhead">H)</span><span class="bodytext"> To adjust the clearance of the Upper Looper <a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">refer to bending diagrams &#147;C&#148; and &#147;D&#148;</a>. Moving the Upper Looper from path 1 to path 2 or 1 to 3 (<a href="upperlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">diagram 4</a>) will increase or decrease the clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle. It will also do the opposite to the clearance between the Upper Looper and the Lower Looper. For example, if moving from path 1 to path 3 increases your clearance between the Upper and Lower Looper, it will also decrease your clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle. </span></p> <p align="left"><span class="bodytext"><a href="upperlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Click Here for UPPER LOOPER SETTING DIAGRAMS</a></span></p> <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">I)</span> Adjusting the Upper Looper (<a href="upperlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">diagram 4</a>) along path 1 through points a, b, c, d, and e will change the clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle (<a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">bending diagram C</a>). Raising and lowering the Upper Looper affects the clearance by changing the timing of the meeting of the Upper Looper and the Needle. Bending the Upper Looper along this path will also change the meeting place of the point of the Upper Looper and the rear of the Lower Looper. The point of the Upper Looper should fall in the scarf of the Lower Looper right behind the eye See <a href="upperlooper.htm" class="default">diagram 5 and 6</a>. The point of the Upper Looper should not contact the Lower Looper. To determine if there is contact, place the tip of your left index finger on the exposed shank of the Lower Looper. Turn the Hand Wheel slowly while holding your finger to the Looper, if there is contact you will feel it. Adjust and recheck until the contact disappears.</p> <p align="left" class="bodytext"><a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Click Here for LOOPER BENDING DIAGRAMS</a></p> <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">J)</span> At this point your Loopers should be reasonably set and working with each other and the Needle. Two more adjustments can be made, but they are generally not necessary. <a href="lowerlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Diagram 8</a> shows the angle of the Lower Looper, this is pre-set at 3-1/2 degrees. Following bending <a href="lowerlooper.htm" class="default">diagram F</a>, you can increase or decrease this angle to affect the clearance between the point of the Upper Looper and the rear of the Lower Looper. <a href="upperlooper.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Diagram 7</a> shows rotating the head of the Upper Looper (<a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">bending diagram G or H</a>).

If the Upper Looper is blind (no eye) set it as high as possible making sure the point still clears the eye of the Lower Looper. This presents a wider open loop of thread for both Needles to penetrate. If the Upper Looper is eyed it may be necessary to set the point lower to keep the Thread Loop open for needle penetration. It is more common to have to follow head rotation <a href="looperbending.htm" target="_blank" class="default">diagrams G and H</a> when setting the Upper Looper for two Needle style machines.</p> <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">L)</span> Single thread machines have a blind Lower Looper.

(Note Section 1) When threading the Looper Threads, it is convenient to use a Threading Wire (37-318). Insert the thread or yarn into the eye of the Threading Wire, pass the Threading Wire through the Thread Eyes and Tension Discs as shown on the Threading Diagram. To thread the Lower Looper: Turn the Hand Wheel until the Needle is in its highest position to locate the Lower Looper&#146;s eye directly in line with the Lower Looper Thread Tube; pass the Threading Wire (with the Lower Looper Thread in its eye) through the Lower Looper Thread Tube, and the eye of the Lower Looper. Pull the Lower Looper Thread through to the top of the Needle Plate. To thread the Upper Looper: Keep the Needle in the same high position, turn the Hand Wheel to position if necessary. Bend the threading wire into a curve and thread its eye with the upper looper thread. Insert the threading wire into the tube in the Dust Shield (in some cases this tube is in the Frame Cap). The threading wire should come out above the Needle Plate and in front of the Upper Looper. Take the Upper Looper thread out of the threading wire, and thread through the eye of the Upper Looper. Care should be taken when threading the eye of the Upper Looper.

The standard setting would have them adjusted so that the fabric going into the stitch will be trimmed to the width of the Chaining Finger on the Needle Plate.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">2)</span> The Lower Cutter Holder slides in the L.C.H. Support Assembly allowing right to left (lateral) movement of the Lower Cutter. Some Lower Cutter Holders have an internal spring to maintain pressure between the Upper and Lower Cutter. In some cases you may wish to fix the position of the Lower Cutter; to do this, tighten the screw 85 3/16 at the desired position. Make sure you are only applying light pressure against the Upper Cutter.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">3)</span> The U.C.C. Thrust Block supports the force against the Upper Cutter Carrier by the cutters. After extended service it may be necessary to adjust this block by means of Adjusting Screw 81 3/16 and the clamp screw 55 3/16. There should be about 1 thousandth of an inch of clearance between the Thrust Block and the Upper Cutter Carrier.</p>`~`<p class="subhead"><a name="adjustment"></a>Knife Adjustment</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">4)</span> Set the height of the Lower Cutter so that the cutting edge is slightly above the surface of the Needle Plate and tighten the Lower Cutter clamp nut 2 5/32. Make sure the height of the blade does not interfere with the Presser Foot.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">5)</span> Clamp the L.C. Holder to the width of trimming desired by screw 85 3/16. Turn the Hand Wheel over until the upper cutter is in its lowest position of travel. At this position, the top of the cutting edge of the Upper Cutter should be even with the top of the Lower Cutter&#146;s cutting edge. This setting is obtained by adjusting the Upper Cutter Clamp Screw 37 or 38 5/32 and the Upper Cutter Holder Clamp Screw 8 1/8.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">6)</span> Turn the Hand Wheel over again until the Upper Cutter is in its highest position of travel. The downward projection of the Upper Cutter must never travel above the height of the Lower Cutter. If it goes above the Lower Cutter, you must readjust the settings made in step 40 above to prevent the Upper Cutter from breaking the Lower Cutter.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">7)</span> The two Cutters must remain in contact with each other in order to cut cleanly. Turn the Hand Wheel so the Upper Cutter in its highest travel position, and loosen the L.C.H. Clamp Screw 85 3/16. Press the Lower Cutter holder lightly to the right until contact is made with the Upper Cutter and tighten the L.C.H.C. Screw. Some machines have spring type supports like the one shown; on this support you only have to loosen the L.C.H.C. Screw, and the spring applies the pressure needed to cut. Do not allow the Lower Cutter to push too tightly against the Upper Cutter. If more than light pressure is required to make a clean cut, the blades are probably dull and should be sharpened on a Merrow Cutter Grinder.</p>`~~`<p class="subhead">Feed Dogs</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">1)</span> Feed Dogs are normally provided with either coarse or fine cut teeth, single row or double row, depending on the material you are sewing. Generally, the Feed Dogs should be set as low as practical to allow the work to feed. The length of feed can be changed by removing the Feed Eccentric and substituting an eccentric of shorter or longer stroke. Feed Eccentrics (6-82-#) are marked to indicate approximately the number of stitches per inch produced at the edge of the fabric.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">2)</span> The Feed Dog and Needle Plate must match each other and it may be necessary to change Feed Dogs to prevent interference with the Needle Plate when very few stitches per inch are used.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">3)</span> Machines designated by the letter &#147;D&#148; in the style marking contain a differential or gathering feed. The differential feed contains two separate Feed Dogs, with separate Feed Carriers and separate Feed Eccentrics. This separation allows the front Feed Dog to be set up to travel farther than the rear Feed Dog. This gathers the fabric and prevents it from being stretched or lengthened while it is being sewn. The difference in the throw of the two Feed Eccentrics creates the &#147;differential&#148; feed. The difference between the two can be very little or quite large depending on the number of stitches per inch you desire and on the elasticity (stretch) of the fabric.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">4)</span> On certain fabrics it may be desirable to tilt the Feed Mechanism. To make this adjustment loosen the Set Screw 48 5/32, then slowly turn the Feed Carrier Block Pin to the desired location and tighten the set screw. When the screw slot in the F.C. Block Pin is level with the base of the machine, the feed dogs will be in their standard position. It is never necessary to remove the Set Screw 48 5/32.</p>`~`<p class="subhead"><a name="presserfoot"></a>Presser Foot and Presser Foot Finger</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">5)</span> The center hinged type Presser Foot is generally used since it is convenient for seaming or edging where seams or thick and thin places must be crossed. Rigid and rear hinged type Presser Feet are available for special purposes. After lifting the Presser Foot Latch, the Presser Foot Arm with its Presser Foot may be swung out to provide access to the Needle and Loopers.<br> <span class="smsubhead">6)</span> A &#147;stub&#148; or short Presser Foot Finger is used if the machine is equipped with a Needle Plate with a chaining finger. A long P.F. Finger is used with a Needle Plate with a stub or short chaining finger. The finger guards the right side of the Needle. This should be adjusted sideways so that the left hand edge of the finger (next to the Needle) just clears the Needle when the Needle is in the full down position.<br> <span class="smsubhead">7)</span> Ordinarily, use as little pressure on the Presser Foot as possible. This pressure is adjustable by the Screw 6 3/8. A set Screw 13 5/32 holds Screw 6 3/8 in position so your adjustment does not change while the machine is running.</p> <p class="bodytext" align="center"><img src="images/presserfoot.gif" width="469" height="352"></p>`~~`<p class="bodytext"><span class="subhead">LUBRICATION</span><br> </p> <table width="151" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" vspace="8" hspace="8"> <tr> <td><a href="oiling.htm" target="_blank"><img src="images/oilingparts2.gif" width="151" height="132" border="0"></a></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <div align="center"><a href="oiling.htm" class="default" target="_blank">Click for larger image</a></div></td> </tr> </table> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">1)</span> General: The lubrication system is entirely automatic, feeding oil to all bearing surfaces without the use of wicks. The path of the oil as it circulates through the machine is described as follows: Two Oil Pump Plungers are operated from eccentric grooves in the main shafts. The upper shaft pump draws oil from the main reservoir and forces it through the Oil Bubbler Pipe to the Oil Bubbler Pipe Cap. The oil then drains down through holes to the Upper Shaft Oil Collector and the correct amount of oil is fed into the Upper Shaft Assembly. Inside the Upper Shaft the oil is distributed through several successive oil holes and grooves to the bearing surfaces of the main shafts on the left end of the machine, the Needle Carrier Assembly, the Upper Cutter Carrier Assembly, and the Feed Mechanism. Some of the oil not fed into the Upper Shaft is forced along the outside of the Upper Shaft, down the face of the Cam Boss, and through holes in the Main Cams to lubricate the Cam Rolls and the Frame Cap bearings. The Needle Bearing for the Lower Shaft is oiled from the overflow oil from the lower shaft pump. All the oil in the machine drains down through the Oil Filter into the Oil Filter Support and is pumped from this support by the lower shaft pump back into the oil reservoir.</p> <p class="bodytext"><b><i>Note: A special oiling Frame M-1-A-11 (MG) or M-1-5 (M) is available on request for high needle time operations.

About 8 ounces of a high grade turbine oil is recommended. (Refer to the Oil List page 24) To drain the oil, remove the machine from the Machine Mounting Assembly and extend the hand wheel end of the machine over the end of the table.

Loosen set screws 2-#3 or 1-#8 and remove Loopers.</li> <li class="bodytext">Insert Lower Looper into the Lower Looper Carrier. Push it into the carrier until you feel it stop against the pin. Tighten the set screw 2-#8 against the flat spot on the shank of the looper. <b><font color="003366" class="bodytext">Note: Before inserting the Looper make sure the hold in the Looper Carrier and the area around it are clean. If you push dirt into the hole the Looper will stick out too far and become hard to adjust properly. If this has happened, remove the <a href="bs-framecap-lrg.htm" class="default">Frame Cap</a> and clean out the Looper Carriers from the opposite end with a wire or pipe cleaner.</font></b></li> <li class="bodytext">Turn the Hand Wheel so that the Needle is at its furthest downward position and the Lower Looper is fully extended to the left in its outward motion (<a href="javascript:popOne()" class="default">see diagram 1</a>). The distance between the point of the lower looper and the Needle should be the thickness of the hook end of your Merrow tweezers 37-225-C. or about 1/32&quot; of an inch (.031). &#147;Type #3 only.&#148; Refer to (<a href="javascript:popFive()" class="default">diagram A</a>) for bending the Lower Looper to this setting.</li> <li class="bodytext">The top corner of the needle point (where the needle meets the blade) should contact the Needle Guard with a little pressure (<a href="javascript:popTwo()" class="default">see diagram 2</a>). To gage this, turn the Hand Wheel to separate the Needle from the Lower Looper. Insert a small scrap of note-paper (this is approximately 3 thousandths of an inch thick) between the Needle and Lower Looper. Turn the Hand Wheel back so that just the thickness of the paper is caught between the Needle and the Looper. You should be able to remove the paper, but you should feel a slight drag against it as you pull it out. Refer to (<a href="javascript:popSix()" class="default">diagram G</a>) for adjusting Lower Looper type #3 to this setting and (<a href="javascript:popSeven()" class="default">diagram B</a>) for #1 and #2 Loopers.</li> <li class="bodytext">Turn the Hand Wheel slightly until the point of the Lower Looper arrives behind the Needle. The point of the Lower Looper should contact the rear surface of the Needle, but it should not deflect the Needle (<a href="javascript:popFour()" class="default">see diagram 3</a>). The note-paper gage used above also works here. If you are using a &quot;scarfed&quot; Needle, the point of the Lower Looper should still contact, but not deflect the Needle. Generally, a Lower Looper is set tighter to a &quot;scarfed&quot; Needle than a standard Needle. Refer to (<a href="javascript:popSeven()" class="default">diagram B</a>) to adjust the point of the Lower Looper Type #1 and Type #2 to the Needle and (<a href="javascript:popEight()" class="default">diagram H</a>) for #1 and #3 type Loopers.</li> <li class="bodytext">Insert Upper Looper into the Upper Looper Carrier as far as it will go. Tighten set screw (1#8) against the flat spot on the shank of the Looper.</li> <li class="bodytext">Gently turn the Hand Wheel over. The Upper Looper if correctly inserted in the carrier will allow the Needle to pass just behind the head. It should also be far enough forward so that its point passes directly behind the head of the type #1 and type #3 lower loopers; or through the scarf, just behind the eye of the type #2 Lower Looper. Look for interference (contact) between the Upper Looper and Needle, or the Upper Looper and Lower Looper. The Upper Looper should NOT contact either the Needle or the Lower Looper. If there is contact, adjust the Upper Looper to clear the one it is contacting. If it is contacting both, adjust the Upper Looper to clear the one it is contacting with the most interference first.</li> <li class="bodytext">To adjust the clearance of the Upper Looper refer to bending (diagrams <a href="javascript:popNine()" class="default">C</a> and <a href="javascript:popTen()" class="default">D</a>). Moving the Upper Looper from path 1 to path 2 or 1 to 3 (<a href="javascript:popThree()" class="default">diagram 4</a>) will increase or decrease the clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle. It will also do the opposite to the clearance between the Upper Looper and Lower Looper. For example, if moving from path 1 to path 3 increases your clearance between the Upper and Lower Looper, it will also decrease your clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle.</li> <li class="bodytext">Adjusting the Upper Looper (<a href="javascript:popThree()" class="default">diagram 4</a>) along path 1 through the points a,b,c,d, and e will change the clearance between the Upper Looper and the Needle (<a href="javascript:popNine()" class="default">bending diagram C</a>). Raising and lowering the Upper Looper affects the clearance by changing the timing of the meeting of the Upper Looper and the Needle. Adjusting the Upper Looper along this path will also change the meeting place of the point of the Upper Looper and the rear of the Lower Looper. The point of the Upper Looper should come up behind the head of type #1 and #2, and fall in the scarf of Lower Looper type #3 right behind the eye (<a href="javascript:popEleven()" class="default">see diagram 5 and 6</a>). The point of the Upper Looper should not contact the Lower Looper. To determine if there is contact, place the tip of your left index finger on the exposed shank of the Lower Looper. Turn the Hand Wheel over slowly while holding your finger on the Lower Looper, if there is contact you will feel it. Adjust and recheck until the contact disappears.</li> <li class="bodytext">At this point your Loopers should be reasonably set and working with each other and the Needle. Two more adjustments can be made, but they are generally not necessary. (<a href="javascript:popEleven()" class="default">Diagram 8</a>) shows the angle of the Lower Looper, this is pre-set at 3-1/2 degrees. Following bending (<a href="javascript:popTwelve()" class="default">diagram F</a>), you can increase or decrease this angle to affect the clearance between the point of the Upper Looper (<a href="javascript:popThirteen()" class="default">bending diagram E</a>). This maintains the clearance between the Needle and the Upper Looper, while bringing the point of the Upper Looper closer to or farther away from the Lower Looper.</li> <li class="bodytext">When setting two-thread machines 70-2D- or M-2D- or 70-D3B-3 follow the above steps. If the Upper Looper is blind (no eye) set it as high as possible making sure the point still clears the eye of the Lower Looper. This presents a wider loop of thread for the Needle to penetrate. It is more common to follow head rotation (<a href="javascript:popThirteen()" class="default">diagram E</a>) when setting the Upper Looper for two-thread style machines.</li> <li class="bodytext">Single-thread machines have a blind Lower Looper. These are set the same as an eyed Lower Looper, except rotating the point to the Needle requires the use of diagram I instead of E.

The Hook should pass the NNeedle on its outward and inward strokes through the Scarf Area of the Needle. Make sure the Needle Guard is set flush to the back edge of the Needle. It helps to align the Needle or Needle Bar and Needle so that the Scarf of the Needle when viewed from above would run from 8:00 to 2:00 as opposed to dead flat (9:00 to 3:00). The Latch hook itself can be set with a slight downward tilt from rear to front; this gains room between the Latch and the Needle and aids in the Latch Hook&#146;s shedding process. The Hook Carrier Guide can be so tight that it is forcing the Hook into the Needle. Loosen the Hook Carrier Guide Screw and tap the Hook Carrier Guide towards the rear of the machine. <strong>Warning: too loose and the Hook will not engage the Needle.</strong></p>`~`<p class="subhead"><a name="loosestitches"></a>LOOSE STITCHES</p> <p class="bodytext">The stitch is loose on the fabric. Adjust Edge Guide to allow more material to get into the stitch. Tighten Thread Tension(s). You may have the wrong Crochet Machine for your particular application. The main Cams fix the width of the stitch in these machines. You can&#146;t make an 18-E (1/2&quot;) produce a _&quot; stitch by tightening the Thread Tension, or changing a Finger Plate.</p>`~`<p class="subhead"><a name="skippedstitches"></a>SKIPPED STITCHES</p> <p class="bodytext">As a general rule, try replacing the Latch Hook and/or the Needle when a skipping problem is present. Some times the Latch Hook or the Needle has become bent or damaged slightly, and therefore not sewing correctly. If you still have a skip, determine the nature and location of the stitch, and it will help you correct the problem. Does the skip always occur at or near a specific location, if so it probably has to do with handling or thickness of the material. Handling cause a skip when the operator pulls the goods off the Finger as the stitch is being formed. Thickness or a tight corner can cause a skip as the stitch can only be formed at speed in a consistent smooth manner. A single skip that is consistently a set distance apart on the goods shows a disturbance in the flow of the thread to the machine. Check for proper threading, check the Thread Guides for burrs, check the Thread Stand, and check the spool of yarn itself. The thread can wrap around the Thread Stand and cause extra drag. The Spool itself can have a consistent bad spot every so many inches that are due to damage or tension during its winding process. A skip on the top of the goods versus the bottom points you to the relationship between the Needle and the Latch Hook. A skip on top of the goods means the Latch is not picking off the Needle above the work, or the Latch is not shedding the loop properly. A skip on the bottom of the goods means that the Hook is not catching the thread off the Needle below the Needle Plate. Adjustment of Hook Setting, (length and tilt) and adjustment of the Needle Timing in relation to the Latch Hook should correct this problem. Skipping can also occur if the Feed Dogs are dull or improperly set. Poor feeding doesn&#146;t allow the natural chaining of the stitch to occur, thus changing the timing of the interaction of the loops. Note that fabric and Stitch Guards can also cause this poor chaining. On some of the Crochet Machines the Presser Foot must be in place in order for the machine to stitch. This again is because the foot holds the thread in time and location to allow the interaction of the Hook and Needle. The Supplemental Thread Carrier on some models also plays a key role, whether it is carrying a thread or not. The Supplemental Thread Carrier actually pushes the thread from the Needle above the Plate back into the Latch Hook; similar to the way the Presser Foot on some models holds the same thread to be caught by the Latch Hook. The Moving Cast Off Horn and the Fixed Cast Off Horn also can cause a skip if improperly set, they must force the shedding of the loop down the Latch Hook past the Latch. This allows the Latch to close around the next loop and interlock the two loops thus forming a stitch. </p>`~`<p class="subhead"><a name="breakingneedles"></a>BREAKING NEEDLES</p> <p class="bodytext">Check that Needle is set properly.

Its purpose is to prevent the Needle from being caught by the hook of the Latch Hook. If the Guard is set too far back it can prevent the hook from catching the thread as it passes the Needle. Some Needle Guards perform two functions. They have a hole or groove that the Needle slides through, and a Latch Opener. The Latch Opener should be kept sharp and smooth; but not as sharp as a cutting edge. Never use a Needle that is too large for the groove of the Needle Guard. Some Needle Guards have replaceable guard pieces that mate to a Guard Holder. </p>`~`<p class="bodytext">This bar can be adjusted to set the height of the Needle in relation to the Latch Hook. See above section on Needles.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Moving Cast Off Horn pushes the Loops down the Hook past the Latch. It also helps control the length or amount of Supplemental Thread that is in the purl or edge of the Stitch Loops. The Moving Cast Off Horn should be set so that the point of the Horn on its rearward travel captures the Supplemental Thread while the Hook is catching both the Needle and the Supplemental Thread. The Horn must also be set far enough forward so that the Horn sheds the loops formed around it on its forward travel path. The Horn can also be adjusted laterally (right to left) to optimize its path and prevent contact or interference with the Hook.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">Some models (18-E) are equipped with a Stationary Cast Off Horn. This should be adjusted so that the rear section is horizontal, parallel to the Work Plate. The Cast Off Horn should force the loop down the Hook past the latch; it should not contact (touch) the Hook.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Needle Lever Connection must be maintained and adjusted on a regular basis. Maintenance consists of oiling the appropriate holes to allow oil to flow to the running surfaces of the Needle Lever Connection. If the machine is in use eight hours a day, this oiling should be done once an hour. (Only a few drops need to be applied.) Less use requires less frequent oiling; more use requires more frequent oiling. The Needle Lever Connection is made of cast iron and is lapped to fit at the factory with the proper Hand Wheel/Driving Pulley. Adjustment to this lapped fit is necessary over time, as operation will loosen this fit. To tighten the fit, remove the two number 1103-16 screws from the top of the Needle Lever Connection, and the two number 193-16 screws form the bottom of the Needle Lever Connection. The two small half round sections removed from the Needle Lever Connection by removing the above screws, should be sanded on a piece of emery (abrasive) cloth along the flat surface where they mate with the center section of the Needle Lever connection. Sand these pieces a little at a time, clean and re-fit them together. Be careful not to remove too much material or the fit to the Needle Lever Ball, or the Hand Wheel will be too tight.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">Use the Hook Gage supplied with the machine to set the proper length on the Hook. The Hook should extend the distance of the gage from the tip of the Hook to the Hook Carrier. This gage is a starting point; different thread or fabric may make it necessary for you to increase or decrease the length of the Hook. The Hook should be level in the Carrier. The Latch should not be point up or down when open. You can adjust the Latch to be down if the Hook is striking the Needle.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Hook Carrier Guide should be adjusted so that the Hook Carrier travels freely in and out of the machine. The Guide must be tight enough to prevent lateral (front to rear) movement of the Hook Carrier. Lateral movement can cause the Hook to miss the Needle and skip stitches. To adjust the Hook Carrier Guide loosen the Lock Screw on the left end face of the frame above the Work Plate. After loosening the Lock Screw, the Guide can be tapped forward toward the front of the machine to tighten the gap between the Carrier and the Guide. Turn the Hand Wheel over; if the machine feels tight tap the guide to the rear. Find a balance point between no lateral play in the Carrier and freedom of movement of the machine. Re-tighten the Lock Screw.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Finger Plate is adjusted in and out of the machine by locking the Finger Plate Clamp 1482 with screw 1353-16. To determine the best position of the Plate, find where the Hook just misses the edge of the Plate on its return stroke into the machine. This is a good starting point. The Plate should hold the stitches being formed, and help draw the loop down the Shank of the Hook. But, the Hook should not contact the Plate. </p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The 18-S model is equipped with a spreader that employs the Moving Cast Off Horn Mechanism to drive it.</p> <p class="bodytext">The Spreader should be set to allow it to pick up the thread between the Needle and the Latch and then shed it upon the return cycle of the Latch Hook. The Spreader can be adjusted both laterally and in and out.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Tension(s) should be set light. Generally, the Tension Nuts are at the very end, flush with the posts. When two threads are used in the Needle, they should pass through separate tensions. When using only a single thread on machines that are equipped with a Supplemental Thread Carrier: Leave the adjustments to the Supplemental Thread Carrier alone, and tighten or loosen the Needle tension.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">Feed Dogs should be set so that the teeth of the Dogs are below the Needle Plate during the return (forward) stroke. If they are above, back feeding and skipping will occur. The height of the Feed Dogs are adjusted on the 15,17 and 18 class machines by loosening the Feed Dog Screw and raising or lower the Feed Dog to the desired position, then tighten the Feed Dog Screw. On the FJ, and FJT Class machines the feed Dog height is adjusted by loosening the Screw on the Feed Adjusting Wedge 21575. Sliding the Wedge forward and back raises and lowers the Feed Dog. Once the Dog is in its desired poison, tighten the Screw holding the Feed Adjusting Wedge.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The length of the stitch can be increased or decreased (number of stitches per inch) by changing the Feed Eccentric. Remove the Screw (1183-16) from the left-hand end of the Lower Shaft. The Feed Eccentric should slide off. Eccentrics are marked with a number that corresponds to the relative number of stitches per inch that they feed (4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14). 14617 is approximately three stitches per inch, and 14621 is approximately two stitches per inch. All figures are approximate as fabric and condition of the machine can retard the Feed.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext">The Shell Stitch Crochet Machine Feeds are adjusted by loosening the Feed Adjusting Nut (11-4NUT), and sliding the Bolt in the slot on the Feed Lever 2116A. Higher on the Feed Lever shortens the Feed stroke, and lower on the Feed Lever lengthens the feed stroke. Again a Feed Eccentric can be changed to facilitate even more or even less throw. These Eccentrics are as follows: 21190, 4/64&quot; throw; 21248, 10/64&quot; throw; 21586, 9/32&quot; throw; 2189, 20/64&quot; throw. All are attached to the Lower Shaft with a 161-4 Set Screw. If the number of stitches per shell is not the desired amount, you can change the Feed Gear and Feed Raising Cams to achieve the stitch quantity desired. See the chart below for available combinations.</p> <table width="80%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#003366"> <tr bgcolor="#CC0000"> <td><span class="smsubhead"><font color="#FFFFFF">FJ Class machines:</font></span></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Feed Gear</strong></font></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Feed Raising Cams</strong></font></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Screws</strong></font></td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Plain- and Three-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21898</td> <td>EXC325 (Plain)<br> EXC326 (Three)</td> <td>1413-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Plain- and Four-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21846</td> <td>21847 (Plain)<br> 21881B (Four)</td> <td>1413-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Plain- and Six-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21898</td> <td>21897 (Plain)<br> 21900 (Six)</td> <td>143-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Plain- and Eight-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21846</td> <td>21847 (Plain)<br> 21848 (Eight)</td> <td>143-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td height="37">Three- and Six-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21898</td> <td>21399, 21399C (Three)<br> 21900 (Six)</td> <td>143-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Four- and Eight-Stitch Shells</td> <td>21846</td> <td>21881A (Four)<br> 21848 (Eight)</td> <td>143-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table width="80%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#003366"> <tr bgcolor="#CC0000"> <td><span class="smsubhead"><font color="#FFFFFF">FJT Class machines:</font><br> </span><span class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF">(Note: All FJT-3 models were discontinued 01/01/2005)</font></span><span class="smsubhead"> </span></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Feed Gear</strong></font></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Feed Raising Cams</strong></font></td> <td class="bodytext"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Screws</strong></font></td> </tr> <tr class="bodytext"> <td>Plain, Four and Eight</td> <td>21920</td> <td>21921 (Plain)<br> 21922 (Four)<br> 21848 (Eight)</td> <td>1413-16<br> 1643-16<br> 1553-16</td> </tr> </table>`~`<p class="bodytext">The 15 and 17 series use the Supplemental Thread Carrier to add a decorative thread to the edge of the stitch. The Supplemental Thread Carrier is also used by the FJ and FJT Series to add a decorative thread and to help control the stitch. The 15 and 17 series machines can work without the Supplemental Thread Carrier, the FJ and FJT Series require it to make the stitch. In either case the Supplemental Thread Carrier can be installed and not threaded. </p> <p class="bodytext">The Supplemental Thread Carrier moves back and forth over the Presser Foot, to carry the extra thread into the throat of the Hook. The Supplemental Thread Carrier should be adjusted a low as possible, but should always clear the Hook. The Supplemental Thread Carrier is adjustable vertically, and can be rotated by loosening the Screw at the left hand end of the Rocker Shaft. It can be adjusted forward and backward by loosening the Clamp Screw on the upper end of the Cam Lever on the Rocker Shaft. </p> <p class="bodytext">On the FJ and FJT Series Machine the Supplemental Thread Carrier carries the Needle thread forward on the outstroke of the Hook. The Needle thread slips off the Supplemental Thread Carrier at its farthest forward position. The Needle thread is then forced back into the Hook by the rearward stroke of the Supplemental Thread Carrier.</p>`~`<p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">Adjustable Thread Guides and Take-up for Needle:</span><br> The Needle thread should pass from the Thread Stand downward diagonally to the Thread Eye behind the right tension. Pass the Needle thread between the Tension Discs the down through the Outer Hole in the Needle Thread Take-Up, the through the Eye in the Lower Front of the Head of the machine, then through the Eye of the Needle from the front. Single-thread operation should follow the above threading.</p> <p class="bodytext">Alternately, you can pass the Needle Thread through the Lower Adjustable Thread Guide after it passes through the Needle Thread Take-Up and before it goes through the Eye on the lower front of the head of the machine. The Lower Adjustable Guide will change the amount of Needle Thread that goes into the stitch. Raising the Guide increases the thread in the stitch. Lowering the Guide decreases the thread in the stitch.</p> <p class="bodytext"><span class="smsubhead">Adjustable Thread Guides and Take-up for Supplemental Thread</span><br> The Supplemental Thread passes through a Thread Eye at the left-hand side of the head of the machine, then between the Tension Discs, then down to the Upper Adjustable Thread Guide then to the inner hole of the Needle Thread Take-Up, then left and down through the Middle Adjustable Thread Guide, then down and to the rear through the Eye in the lower portion of the head of the machine, and finally through the Supplemental Thread Carrier. </p> <p class="bodytext">The Middle Adjustable Thread Guide influences the length of the Supplemental Thread that goes into the edge of the stitch. Raising the Guide increases the length and loosens the edge. Lowering the Guide decreases the length and tightens the edge. The Upper Adjustable Edge Guide influences the uniformity of the edge of the stitch. Raising this Guide loosens the edge finish of the stitch, while lowering tightens the edge finish of the stitch. Do not set this Guide too low. Setting this Guide too low will cause the Supplemental Thread to be drawn when the needle is moving into its uppermost position. </p> <p class="bodytext">A good starting position for the Three Adjustable Thread Guides would be: The Upper Adjustable Guide set close to the Supplemental Thread Tension Discs. The Middle Adjustable Guide set just slightly below horizontal. The Lower Adjustable Guide should be set at a downward angle with the thread being down near the frame. This is a position from which you can make any necessary adjustments to the stitch following the above recommendations. <strong>Note: The moving Cast Off Horn will also affect the Stitch Tension and should be adjusted as below to work with these adjustable guides.</strong></p> <p class="subhead">Threading Diagrams:</p> <table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#003366"> <tr> <td><div align="center"> <p class="smsubhead">One Thread Diagram</p> <p><img src="images/onethread-sm.gif" width="229" height="177"></p> <p class="bodytext"><a href="onethread.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Click here to view larger image</a></p> </div></td> <td><p align="center" class="smsubhead">Two Thread Diagram</p> <p align="center"><img src="images/twothread-sm.gif" width="229" height="177"></p> <p align="center" class="bodytext"><a href="twothread.htm" target="_blank" class="default">Click here to view larger image</a></p></td> </tr> </table>`~`<p class="bodytext">Some models are equipped with a Fabric Guard that mounts directly behind the Finger Plate. This Guard should be set as near to the finger as possible, but still allow space for the stitch to shed off the Finger. It also should be set as near to the Latch Hook as possible, but it never should contact the Latch Hook. The Guard helps the Latch Hook form the loops on the Finger Plate by controlling the shedding of the loops off the finger.</p>`
