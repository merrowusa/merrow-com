  <p> We have been designing needles for 130 years... </p> <p>Almost every needle you will find elsewhere is a copy of an industry standard needle. Ours are not. </p> <p> Merrow has designed thousands of sewing machines for tens of thousands of applications. Different applications need different needles -- hence our 75 styles of sewing needle </p>

<p> we make teflon coated needles, crochet needles, latch hooks and delicate needles for lingerie among others </p>
<p> Our needles are manufactured by the best needle manufacturer in the industry -- hint: they're german -- They are made exclusively for Merrow and ARE NOT sold, copied or otherwise distributed under ANY OTHER trade name. </p><p> Merrow Needles are the best in the industry, if sewing matters then our needles will as well. </p>

<p> Merrow distribution worldwide is outstanding. We are represented in 85 countries around the world</p><p> Each agent may specialize in specfic products or types of products -- in many cases with products that add value to Merrow <p> <p> Through an innovative global commerce model, Merrow enables agents who sign up for our worldwide store to offer the products and services that distinguish them from in our industry <p> <p> In many ways our distribution network is a perfect extension of the Merrow brand, and we support these businesses as if they were our own </p> <p> This is a free service for our agents -- however they must sign up -- so if you don't see your favorite Merrow distributor's store, send us a note we'll begin working on their store right away. </p>
