  #######################################

  ### Install ###
  To install osTicket, you will need to run the setup file
  http://www.example.com/hcl/modules/osTicket/setup.php

  Make sure the admin account has the same login information as an admin
  account in HCL

  The database does not need to be the same as your HCL installation
  but you can keep it in the same database

  ### Activate ###
  Once the installation is complete, you will need to activate the module
  by opening the /modules/ostTicket/hcl/config.php file and changing

  $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['osTicket']['active'] = false;

  to

  $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['osTicket']['active'] = true;
