    // This polling file finds an operator for the chat session.
    // It balances the load so that the operator with the minimum number of chats gets
    // the request. If there are two operators with the same least number of chats then
    // it selects the one with the lowest polling number. It also checks to make sure
    // that the chat request is not sent to the same operator it was sent to last.
