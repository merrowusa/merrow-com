  - Make sure you have created a database for HCL


  ### Method 1 - FTP ###
  - Unzip the files on your local machine
  - If you have safe_mode on, change the config setting $conf['safe_mode'] to true in the config.php file
  - Upload the entire 'hcl' directory (you can re-name the directory if you wish)
  - CHMOD /config.php to 777
  - CHMOD /icons/ to 777
  - CHMOD /compile/ to 777
  - CHMOD /cache/ to 777
  - You will need to make sure you have a MySQL database avalaible for installation.
  - Open you browser and go to the setup directory e.g. http://www.example.com/hcl/setup
  - Follow the instructions.


  ### Method 2 - SSH ###
  - wget the HCL zip file
  - unzip the file
  - CHMOD /config.php to 777
  - CHMOD /icons/ to 777
  - CHMOD /compile/ to 777
  - CHMOD /cache/ to 777
  - If you have safe_mode on, change the config setting $conf['safe_mode'] to true in the config.php file
  - You will need to make sure you have a MySQL database avalaible for installation.
  - Open you browser and go to the installation setup e.g. http://www.example.com/hcl/setup
  - Follow the instructions.
  
  
  ### More Config Options ###
  - Open config.php once the setup is complete to make use of any other config options


  ### Additional Installation Requirements ###
  If you are planning to use HCL's built in file transfer feature, you will need
  to make sure LimitRequestBody is set to a number higer than the value of upload_max_filesize and
  post_max_size in your php.ini
  If you do not do this, file transfers over the size of LimitRequestBody will not work,
  even if php.ini's setting is higher than LimitRequestBody.

  You will only need to make these changes if you have not uploaded the .htaccess files located
  in the root hcl directory, or your server does not allow the variables to be overwritten locally
  
  - Example:
  php.ini upload_max_filesize = 2M
  php.ini post_max_size = 2M
  LimitRequestBody = 49152
  
  This will only allow file transfers of up to 48 kilobytes in size, even the php.ini setting says
  its 2 megabytes. If you cannot find the LimitRequestBody setting in your httpd.conf file or php.conf
  if using Apache 2, your maximum post size will be restricted to Apache's default value, so you will need
  to create it.
  
  - Solution:
  For a start is 2 megabytes is probably too small to deal with for file transfers.
  Here are some 'better' settings..
  
  php.ini upload_max_filesize = 128M
  php.ini post_max_size = 128M
  LimitRequestBody = 134217728
