Why Trademarks Are Important

Trademarks are important because they help to prevent confusion in the marketplace by distinguishing one entity's products and services from the products and services of another.

For example, when a user sees the Help Center Live mark on the Help Center Live software, the user understands that UberTec has either created or endorsed that product, and that the product is subject to the quality control standards of UberTec for that product.

If anyone other than UberTec were to use an Help Center Live mark to promote a service, users could be misled into thinking that the unauthorized person's products or services were created or endorsed by UberTec, or that those products or services met the quality control standards of UberTec.


Trademarks And The GNU General Public License

The GNU General Public License (GPL) permits third parties to use and redistribute the underlying software under certain conditions. Such use and/or redistribution of Help Center Live software products are welcomed by UberTec, but should be distinguished from the use of the Help Center Live marks.

The GPL does not provide any license or right to use an Help Center Live mark in any form or media. Thus, although a GPL licensee may redistribute the underlying software, a GPL licensee may not use a Help Center Live mark, as in doing so, that does not conform to the Help Center Live trademark policy without written permission of UberTec.

By adhering to the Help Center Live trademark policy, you help UberTec to prevent confusion in the marketplace and to protect and enhance the value and integrity of its solutions and marks. UberTec appreciates your cooperation in this effort.
