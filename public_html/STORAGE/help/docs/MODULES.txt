###### Notes ######
  This file is not intented for end users trying to install modules, please read the author's
  installation instructions located in the distributed package, generally called 'HCL_MOD_INSTALL.txt'

####### Module Overview ######
  We aim to make sure producing and implementing modules to Help Center Live is as painless
  as possible so that more great modules get produced, helping Help Center Live to expand and
  so that end users have a hastle free time installing them

###### Coding Standards ######
  We follow Pear's coding standards, and so should you. If you have not heard of Pear, them point
  your browser to http://pear.php.net
  If you spot some code that contradicts the coding standards then please notify us at
  admin@helpcenterlive.com so that we can correct it.

###### License ######
  Your modules should be released under the GNU General Public License. Remember to include the license
  header and your copyright notice at the top of each of your module's files. If you are porting an existing
  application into a module, then the application's license must be compatible with the GPL license.

###### Implementation ######
  Modules will be placed in the 'modules' directory in the root of the Help Center Live main directory.
  Each module should have its own sub-directory within the modules directory. Make sure the name of this
  sub-directory only contains letters a-z and numbers 0-9.
  Inside your module's directory sould be the module's files and also a directory called 'hcl'. The 'hcl'
  directory contains files that allow Help Center Live to recognise the module and know what to do with it.
  The essential files within this directory are 'config.php' which contains configuration options for
  Help Center Live. All configuration options for the module itself should not be in this file, but instead in
  a different file such as 'config.php' in the module's main folder. The other essential file is 'auth.php'
  This file is mainly used for ports of existing applications so that the authentication of the user logged
  into Help Center Live can be passed across into the format required for the apllication that is being ported.
  If you are creating a module from scratch, we urge you to use Help Center Live's existing authentication procedure
  to make things easier.
  The module is wrapped within a tempate called mod_MODULE.tpl where 'MODULE' is the name of your module (the same
  as its directory name). All admin files are wrapped within the admin.tpl that already exists within Help Center
  Live to make things look generic on the admin side.

###### Development ######

  ## Implementation Files ##

  The Help Center Live recognition files discussed above are discussed below in more detail so that you can understand
  what is needed within these files.

   # config.php:

    If you open the 'Help Center' module's config.php file you will see that there are a list of variables being set used
    within the module. They are all commented so please read the file. You can simply copy this config file and use it within
    your module, making sure the variables are changed. All the variables in the Help Center module are required within the
    config file. The most important thing to do is change the name of the config array to your module e.g.:

      $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['HelpCent']...

      to

      $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']...

    where 'MODULE' is the name of your module (the same as its directory name).

   # auth.php:

    This file makes sure the module is cross-authenticated with Help Center Live and is usually only used when existing
    applications are ported into a module. If you are creating a module from scratch and do not need to carry over
    authentication as you are using Help Center Live's authentication directly, you will still need this file to exist, but
    just dont let it do anything.

  ## Templating ##

  You can also include a user-end template for your module that will wrap around the user end of the module. This file
  must be called mod_MODULE.tpl where 'MODULE' is the name of your module (the same as its directory name). This template
  file must be placed within the base directory of the template that is in use. In addition to this, there is one key
  piece of code that must be included in the template:

    {include file=$content}

  This is needed to include the module file being requested.

  ## Programming ##

  Within your module you can declare any of the Help Center Live classes using the code:

    $inc->class();

  The class is then created and can be called from within a global scope
  For example, if your module were to add a department, you would use:

    $inc->department();
    $GLOBALS['department']->insert('Department Name', 'email@example.com');

  Make sure all your module url's are prefixed properly so that they work. There are three different prefixes declared within
  your module's config.php file that all have different uses.

  $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['url'] contains the prefix for your module that will be wrapped using the module file.
  This is generally used for links.
  e.g.: <a href="<?php echo($GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['url']); ?>index.php">Module's Default File</a>

  $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['realurl'] is the actual url to your module. This is usually used for urls that do not
  require wrapping, such as image urls.
  e.g.: <img src="<?php echo($GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['realurl']); ?>images/logo.gif" />

  $GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['selfurl'] is the PHP_SELF variable with the arguements needed for the module wrapper.
  e.g.: <form action="<?php echo($GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['selfurl']); ?>" method="post">

  Note: of you are using a form that send data using GET you will need to make sure the original GET variables are included too.
  To make this easy for you, there is a procedure in the config.php file of your module that creates the input fields for you.
  All you then have to do is call it. e.g.:

    <form action="<?php echo($GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['selfurl']); ?>" method="get">
    <?php echo($GLOBALS['conf']['modules']['MODULE']['getargs']); ?>
    <!-- other form input elements here -->
    </form>

###### Distribution ######
  Module files and instructions of installation should be compressed into a zip or tar file, then posted
  in the appropriate modules forum. We review the modules posted fairly often, and we think your module is
  worthy enough, it will be included in the modules section of the website.

  If you have any questions regarding the development of modules then please do not hesitate to
