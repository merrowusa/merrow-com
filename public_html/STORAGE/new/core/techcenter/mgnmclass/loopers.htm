        <b><font size="-1">1)</font></b><font size="-1"> The Upper and Lower Looper 
        must co-operate with the Needle in order for sewing to occur. Before making 
        any Looper adjustments, always change to a new Needle. A new Needle may 
        solve your problem, without further adjustments.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2)</b> The Upper Loopers are made in two general forms, one for two 
        thread stitching and the other for three thread stitching. Adjustment 
        of both forms are the same.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3)</b> The Loopers are nearly self setting, but they may need slight 
        bending to achieve proper setting. Always bend Loopers slightly farther 
        than the position you desire. The Loopers have a tendency to spring back 
        to their original (pre-bent) position, if you donÿt bend them far enough. 
        Loopers are designed to be bent only in the shank area. The point areas 
        are hardened to prevent wear, and do not take a bend well.<br>
        <br>
        <b>4)</b> To bend the Loopers, we recommend Merrow Looper Bender 30-10. 
        Some people use the shank of a screwdriver, or pliers to do the bending. 
        Please note: If pliers are used, they must be smooth surfaced to prevent 
        damage to the surface of the Loopers. A good light is recommended for 
        visibility when setting the Loopers. A piece of white paper placed behind 
        the Loopers also makes them more visible. <br>

        </font><font size="-1">The following instructions ae designed to give 
        you a general knowledge of Looper setting. You should be able to make 
        any Merrow Class MG or M machine sew after following these instructions. 
        Specific styles will require further "fine tuning" to get the ideal looper 
        setting. Talk to your local Merrow Sales representative for tips on setting 
        your specific style of machine.<br>
        <br>
        </font>
        <blockquote> <font size="-1"><b>a) </b>Swing the Presser Foot Assembly 
          out, and remove the Needle Plate. Remove the Lower Looper Thread Tube, 
          Feed Dogs, Fabric Guard (Upper), and Dust Shield for accessibility. 
          Loosen Set Screws 1 7/32, 100 3/16 and remove Loopers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>b)</b> Insert Lower Looper into the Lower Looper Carrier. Push it 
          down until it stops. Tighten Set Screw 1 7/32 against the flat spot 
          on the shank of the Looper.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="#0000CC"><b>NOTE:</b></font> Before inserting new Looper, 
          make sure the hole in the Looper Carrier and the area around it are 
          clean. If you push dirt into the hole, the Looper will stick out too 
          far and become hard to adjust properly. If this has happened, remove 
          the Frame Cap (Section 50) and clean out Looper Carriers from the opposite 
          end with a wire or pipe cleaner.<br>
          <br>
          <b>c)</b> Turn the Hand Wheel so that the Needle is at its furthest 
          downward position <a href="pics/loopers/lowerlooperdiagram.gif" target="_blank">(see 
          diagram 1)</a>. The distance between the point of the Lower Looper and 
          the Needle should be the thickness of the hook end of your Merrow Tweezers 
          37-225-C, or about 1/32 of an inch (.035). Refer to diagram "A" for 
          bending the Lower Looper to this setting.<br>
          <br>
          <b>d)</b> The top corner of the needlepoint (where the point meets the 
          blade) should contact the needle guard of the Lower Looper with a little 
          pressure. <a href="pics/loopers/lowerlooperdiagram.gif" target="_blank">(See 
          diagram 2)</a> To gage this, turn the Hand Wheel to separate the Needle 
          from the Lower Looper. Insert a small scrap piece of note-paper (this 
          is approximately 3 thousandths of an inch thick) between the Needle 
          and the Lower Looper. Turn the Hand Wheel back so that just the thickness 
          of the paper is caught between the Needle and the Looper. You should 
          be able to remove the paper, but you should feel a slight drag against 
          it as you pull it out. Refer to <a href="pics/loopers/looperbending.gif" target="_blank">diagram 
          "B"</a> for bending Lower Looper to this setting.</font> <br>

          <b><font size="-1">e) </font></b><font size="-1">Turn the Hand Wheel 
          slightly, until the point of the Lower Looper arrives behind the Needle. 
          The point of the Lower Looper should contact the rear surface of the 
          Needle, but it should not deflect the Needle. <a href="pics/loopers/lowerlooperdiagram.gif" target="_blank">(See 
          diagram 3)</a> The note-paper gage used above, also works here. If you 
          are using "scarfed" Needle, the point of the Lower Looper should still 
          contact, but not deflect the Needle. Generally a Lower Looper is set 
          tighter to a "scarfed" Needle than a standard Needle. Refer to <a href="pics/loopers/looperbending.gif" target="_blank">diagram 
          "E"</a> to adjust the point of the Lower Looper to the Needle.<br>
          <br>
          <b>f)</b> Insert Upper Looper into the Upper Looper Carrier as far as 
          it will go. Tighten Set Screw 100 3/16 against the flat spot on the 
          shank of the Looper. (See note above in section "b")<br>
          <br>
          <b>g)</b> Gently turn Hand Wheel over. The Upper Looper should be far 
          enough back that the Needle passes just behind the head. It should also 
          be far enough forward that its point passes through the scarf, just 
          behind the eye of the Lower Looper. Look for interference (contact) 
          between the Upper Looper and Needle, or the Upper Looper and Lower Looper. 
          The Upper Looper should not contact either the Needle or Lower Looper. 
          If there is contact, adjust the Upper Looper to clear the one it is 
          contacting. If it is contacting both, adjust the Upper Looper to clear 
          the one with the most interference first.<br>
          <br>
          <b>h)</b> To adjust the clearance of the Upper Looper refer to bending 
          <a href="pics/loopers/looperbending.gif" target="_blank">diagrams "C" 
          and "D"</a>. Moving the Upper Looper from path 1 to path 2 or 1 to 3 
          <a href="pics/loopers/upperlooperdiagrams.gif" target="_blank">(diagram 
          4)</a> will increase or decrease the clearance between the Upper Looper 
          and the Needle It will also do the opposite to the clearance between 
          the Upper Looper and the Lower Looper.. For example, if moving from 
          path 1 to path 3 increases your clearance between the Upper and Lower 
          Looper, it will also decrease your clearance between the Upper Looper 
          and the Needle.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>

          by changing the timing of the meeting of the Upper Looper and the Needle. 
          Bending the Upper Looper along this path will also change the meeting 
          place of the point of the Upper Looper and the rear of the Lower Looper. 
          The point of the Upper Looper should fall in the scarf of the Lower 
          Looper right behind the eye. <a href="pics/loopers/upperlooperdiagrams.gif" target="_blank">(See 
          diagram 5 and 6)</a> The point of the Upper Looper should not contact 
          the Lower Looper. To determine if there is contact, place the tip of

          the Hand Wheel slowly while holding your finger to the Looper, if there

          Loopers should be reasonably set and working with each other and the 
          Needle. Two more adjustments can be made, but they are generally not 
          necessary. <a href="pics/loopers/upperlooperdiagrams.gif" target="_blank">Diagram 
          8</a> shows the angle of the Lower Looper, this is pre-set at 3-1/2 
          degrees. Following bending <a href="pics/loopers/looperbending.gif" target="_blank">diagram 
          F</a>, you can increase or decrease this angle to affect the clearance

          <br>
          <b>k)</b> When setting two needle machines like MG-4D-67ÿs follow the 
          above steps, except set the loopers to the inside needle. The angle 
          of the Lower Looper may have to be reduced to 2-1/2 degrees from 3-1/2 
          degrees to bring the point closer to the outside needle while remaining 
          close to the inside needle. If the Upper Looper is blind (no eye) set 
          it as high as possible making sure the point still clears the eye of 
          the Lower Looper. This presents a wider open loop of thread for both 
          needles to penetrate. If the Upper Looper is eyed it may be necessary 
          to set the point lower to keep the thread loop open for needle penetration.
