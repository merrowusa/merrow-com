Support Logic Helpdesk 1.1
**************************

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
general:
	- linux OS
	- apache webserver
	- php 4.1.x
	- MySQL

file upload:
	- access to webserver /tmp directory
	- safe_mode Off

email pipe:
	- being able to setup an email pipe/forwarder for your domain


INSTALL:
--------
pre-install steps:
	- extract the archive to your desired directory via:
	  tar -zxfv slogic1.0.tar.gz or download to your machine and extract locally 
	  before uploading via FTP if you prefer
	- create a MySQL database and add a MySQL user to it
	- make the "config.php" file writeable by the webserver, e.g.: chmod 666 or 777
	
install:
	- access "install.php" through your browser and follow the steps
	- if you receive any kind of error afterwards, check you have followed the 
	  pre-install steps above correctly!
	
post-install steps:
	- delete "install.php"
	- delete all "update*.php" files, unless you need to update the helpdesk - refer to "UPDATE"
	- change "config.php" back from being writeable, e.g.: chmod 644
	- login to admin.php 
	- create at least 2 staff members (to avoid errors - you will get an error 
	if you only create 1)! 
	- create a user (useful to test the user part of the script) 
	- change the preset categories 
	- change the preset priorities 
	- change the preset email & pipe messages
	- send some test user tickets and add some staff responses to get used to 
	how the script works
	- use your new helpdesk with your clients! 


TESTING:
--------
- access admin.php for the admin frontend
- access staff.php for the staff frontend
- access index.php for the user frontend

if none of the above show any kind of errors, then the install went successfully 
and you can start using the helpdesk.


UPDATE:
-------
If you have version 1.0,1.1 or 1.1.1 installed then you can run one of the available update*_1.2.php scripts in order to keep your database data.

Make sure to create a backup file of your MySQL database before running the update script, in order to avoid any data loss in case
the update fails.


NEW FEATURES: (see CHANGELOG for version changes - fixed & added features)
------------
improved email pipe 
	- support for multiple email addresses, which can be assigned to ticket categories in admin area -> Categories
	- improved email client support for plain text & HTML only emails 
	- added attachment support for most common attachment types 
	- default email pipe priority can be changed in the admin area -> Config
	- max email limit on a per user & per day basis can be set in the admin area in order to avoid email floods -> Config

self-defineable placeholders 
	- you can assign a placeholder for announcements-, tickets- and the notes content (e.g.: add your own smilies and assign placeholders for them) 
	  EXAMPLE: 	access the admin section and click on "Placeholders" in "Ticket Menu". Now add ":D" (without the "") in the "placeholder"
	  		field and add "<img src="http://www.support-logic.com/demo/smilies/biggrin.gif">" (without the framing "") in the
	  		"Replacement String" field.
	  		Now every ":D" in every announcements-, ticket- and notes content will be replaced with the image.

staff signature 
	- staff members can create a signature, which gets displayed at the end of each ticket note -> Edit Profile

predefined responses 
	- staff members can save predefined responses, which can be selected to be used instead of a self-written note -> Quick replies 

change priority 
	- users are now able to change the priority of a ticket at any time on the "Show Ticket content" page

HTML Tags support 
	- admin can define HTML tags, which are allowed in the announcements-, tickets- and notes content -> Config

Template system 
	The template system now uses the new header & footer style by default, so older template files are incompatible with the default install.
	You can change the used template system during the install process or by changing it in the admin section -> Config
	- new design for all areas (admin, staff & user) 
	- added several colour schemes to choose from (see downloads section at http://www.support-logic.com for additional colour schemes)
	- added header & footer support 
	  the header & footer files can be found in 
	  	modules/admin/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_header.tpl
	  	modules/admin/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_footer.tpl
	  	
	  	modules/staff/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_header.tpl
	  	modules/staff/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_footer.tpl
	  	
	  	modules/users/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_header.tpl
	  	modules/users/slogic/templates/functions/slogic_footer.tpl
					  	
	- the design can now be changed through 1 CSS file per area, which is located in
		modules/admin/slogic/templates/stylesheet.css
		modules/staff/slogic/templates/stylesheet.css
		modules/users/slogic/templates/stylesheet.css
