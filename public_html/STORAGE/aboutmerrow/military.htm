            <p class="bodytext"><img src="images/military.jpg" alt="Military Applications" width="322" height="205" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">Since before the first World War, Merrow machines
              have fulfilled government contracts to sew blankets and socks for
              our servicemen and women. In fact, Merrow developed the federal
              stitch standard for hosiery, which is part of the military specification
            for socks used by our troops. </p>
            <p class="bodytext">Today, the armed forces of the United
              States rely on Merrow Machine&#8217;s
              expertise when it comes to joining and seaming advanced materials.
              The company sews tent covers for tanks that protect them from the
              elements while reducing the infrared signature of their engines.
              Merrow also specializes in seaming space-age materials like woven
              carbon fiber and Kevlar used in military aviation for their high
              strength to weight ratio and ballistic resistance. You&#8217;ll
              find Merrow stitching at work on the Space Shuttle and a variety
              of missile classes, where a butt seam stitch is used to sew together
              bronze screen, which is then laminated with high-tech materials
            to fabricate the rocket engines&#8217; directional cones.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">In addition,
              Merrow sews a special seam for neoprene survival/immersion suits
              used to protect sailors, aircrews and rescuers from hypothermia
              and exposure in extreme ocean and cold water environment conditions.
              The stitch joins and reinforces sections of neoprene without compromising
              the material&#8217;s
              vital insulating characteristics with full-depth needle-hole-penetration
              during processing. When it comes to mission-critical applications,
            Merrow has the knowledge and experience to deliver a reliable solution.</p>
