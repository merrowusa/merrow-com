Since 1838 Merrow has manufactured the world's best overlock sewing machines. A Merrow Machine is built to sew a more precise stitch and operate longer than any other competitive sewing machine in its class.
Merrow Machines are engineered and manufactured more carefully, designed to last decades, and supported with a network of 156 agents in 65 countries. The Merrow Sewing Machine is The Most PRECISE and TOUGHEST sewing machine manufactured in the world

<br />
<br />
Overlock stitching was invented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two, and four-thread sergers, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger. Today Two- and three-thread formations are also known as "merrowing". <br /><br />In 2010 Merrow Machines are engineered and built in Fall River, MA.

<b>Quality of Materials</b><br clear="all"/>

<b>Cams NOT pistons -- Proprietary Cam Technology - Different from all other Sewing Machines</b><br clear="all"/>
We're the only manufacturer in the world building Cam-driven sewing machines that stand up to heavy use. Merrow's Cam-driven machines produces a superior quality stitch. Using sophisticated 5-axis computerized milling machines, we've succeeded in developing proprietary high-technology components offering faster, quieter, operation and remarkable durability.
<br clear="all"/><br clear="all"/>
<b>Merrow Cams are Machined to Exacting Dimensions </b><br clear="all"/>Tolerances are held to .001: the tightest in the industry. They have been designed to operate continuously between 2200 and 5500 RPM. Merrow Cams allow a Merrow Machine to create a perfect stitch while ensuring that the sewing machine will last a lifetime.

<b>  Special consideration should be paid to the intricacies of Merrow's Cam Technology:</b><br clear="all"/>

<li>The Cam groove width and the final surface finish of the Cam groove are created with proprietary manufacturing technology that allows all sides of Merrow's Cam to have an equal, highly polished and uniform steel surface, this results in an approximate coefficient of friction, when lubricated, of .06 or lower.</li>

<li> Cam gear teeth are cut to a unique specifications with the sides of each tooth shaved to create a proprietary profile. This reduces heat when running.</li>

<li> Hardness and metallurgy of the Cams are continuously modified, improving the durability of the Cam. The Benchmark for the durability of a Merrow Cam in continuous operation is more than 30 years of operation without failure. </li>

<b>Sew thousands of different Material Types</b> <br clear="all"/>
Woven Fabric, Knit Fabric, Terry Towel, Denim, Technical Textiles AND Nonwovens. While the machines sew exceptionally on mid-weight woven fabrics, it performs well on a huge number of materials from vulcanized rubber to fiberglass to insulation.   <br clear="all"/><br clear="all"/>
<b>the 5/8" stitch width</b><br clear="all"/>
After years of testing we've determined that a 5/8" stitch is the most effective for joining materials at speed. Wider than the average sewing machine stitch by about double,the 70/72 Class stitch matches a substantial width with high speed sewing. The result is a fast process that is exceptionally versatile.
<br clear="all"/><br clear="all"/><b>Flexibility</b><br clear="all"/>
With more than 75 different needle plates and feed dogs, we can modify that 5/8" sitch to accomodate more demanding fabrics <br clear="all"/><br clear="all"/>
<b>Better than Glueing or Tacking</b><br clear="all"/>
The 5/8" stitch is removable (unless you want to use the LS model), simple and inexpensive to apply
