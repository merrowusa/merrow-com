 <div class="h_headline">FROM GUNPOWDER TO KNITTING MILLS</div>
 <div class="h_subtext">More than 170 years ago, Mr. Joseph Merrow became interested in the manufacture of gunpowder and established a powder mill 24 miles from Hartford Connecticut. When an explosion in 1837 destroyed the Mill, Mr. Merrow decided to build a knitting factory on the same site. The family business turned to the manufacture of knit cotton goods and Merrow Mills became the first business of its kind in the country.</div>
<img src="http://merrow-media.s3.amazonaws.com/general-http/2011_live/hi_12.gif" id="left" width="228" height="150">
<div class="h_subtext">The knitted goods produced at Merrow Mills were made largely of native wool, which was sorted, scoured and dyed, picked, carded and spun into yarn and knitted into hosiery. The product was initially sold locally through commission merchants throughout New York and New England, but following the gold rush of 1849 shipments of goods began to sail to San Francisco and the business became national.  As sales increased, a small machine shop was started to support the knitting equipment in the Mill. </div>

<div class="h_headline">THE OVERLOCK MACHINE</div>
<div class="h_subtext">In Conjunction with the knitting business, sewing machines were constructed in the machine shop for finishing around the tops of men's socks in place of handwork. Devised in 1868 in the machine shop built by his grandfather, the first Merrow Crochet Machine was an invention of Mr. Joseph Millard Merrow. </div>
<img src="http://merrow-media.s3.amazonaws.com/general-http/2011_live/hi_24.gif" id="left" width="209" height="197">
<div class="h_subtext">These new crochet machines were so useful that additional business was undertaken to introduce them to other textile manufacturers. In 1887, when the Merrow knitting mill was again destroyed by fire, the company moved to Hartford and reorganized, concentrating solely on the manufacture of overlock sewing machines. The Merrow Machine Company had taken root. </div>

<div class="h_headline">THE MERROW MACHINE COMPANY</div>
<div class="h_subtext">In Hartford, the company improved upon the initial designs of Joseph M. Merrow and focused on building an expanded line of industrial overlock sewing machines that were used to overedge fabric, add decorative edging, and to support the fabric processing trade by joining fabrics. <img src="http://merrow-media.s3.amazonaws.com/general-http/2011_live/hi_37.gif" id="right" width="211" height="159">
 Between 1893 when the company was officially renamed the Merrow Machine Company, and 1932 when its line of "A Class" machines was introduced, Merrow had an unparalleled impact on the textile industry. The rate of innovation spearheaded by Joseph Millard Merrow is still unequaled in the industry today.   </div>

  <div class="h_headline">UNPARALLELED GROWTH &amp; INNOVATION</div>
  <div class="h_subtext">Joseph Millard Merrow was the driving force behind Merrow's development of new technology, <img src="http://merrow-media.s3.amazonaws.com/general-http/2011_live/hi_10.gif" id="left" width="235" height="181">and its growth from a regional supplier of crochet sewing machines, to the world-wide leader in the manufacture of industrial overlock sewing machines. Under his leadership the company achieved a place of prominence in the industrial sewing machine field with global distribution, hundreds of patents, and the distinction of introducing the industry's first industrial overlock sewing machine. In 1905, Merrow had agents in 35 countries and printed manuals in at least 12 languages. Sales for overlock sewing machines continued to increase and Merrow grew to employ more <img src="http://merrow-media.s3.amazonaws.com/general-http/2011_live/hi_17.gif" id="right" width="244" height="186"> than 500 people in Hartford Connecticut.  Joseph M. Merrow was witness to Merrow's rise to prominence and continued as president of the company until his death in 1947 at age 98.Throughout the 20th century, The Merrow Machine Co. continued to be an industry leader in the design, manufacture, and distribution of industrial sewing machines.  By 1999, Merrow had expanded its agent network to cover more than 60 countries, and had engineered successful sewing solutions for applications ranging from emblem edging to butted seaming.   </div>
