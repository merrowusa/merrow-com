We were introduced to Ramblers through the factory that was producing their garments - the factory was having difficulty sewing Ramblers'' superfine Rambouillet wool on their existing machines, so they brought us in to come up with a solution.  The result - a brand new production grade machine (the MG-2DFS-2) that is capable of handling Ramblerâs unique material.  The factory bought the machines, produced the garments, and Ramblers Way was able to go to market with unique garments that were sewn by unique machines.      ','We worked closely with the folks at Ramblers to make sure that their needs were met and in the end developed a new type of stitch that replaces the cover stitch.  The Merrow Panel Stitch sewn by the MG-2DFS-2 performs better and is more attractive than a traditional cover stitch, allowing Ramblers to promote the unique features of their garments.  Ramblers has moved well beyond their first production run, and the Merrowâs they initially bought continue to run flawlessy.

His newest endeaver, Brightecâ¢, pairs cutting edge technology with tried-and-true practicality.  âMy company makes proprietary glow-in-the dark products that add value to the advertising industry.  When we needed a complimentary finish to some patches we designed, we contacted Merrow for a solution.â  The result, three new models of emblem edging machines based on Merrowâs vaunted MG-3U: the MG-3U NARROW, the MG-3U WIDE, and the MG-2U.  âI told them we had various sized patches with different backings and they created a unique edging for each application.  We ended up putting all the models into production, including the MG-3U.â  ','We met Patrick through one of our dealers who knew that Merrow would be a good fit.  For a startup company like Brightecâ¢, Merrow dependability was an attractive selling point.  âWe didnât want to worry about machines breaking down or not performing properly,â says Patrick, âand Merrow had a reputation for quality&#148;.  We worked together to make sure that the MG-3U''s would keep up with Brightecâs growth, and guided him along the way by providing him with the right thread for all of ','his applications.  We continue to supply Patrick with thread and have since provided him with another variation of the MG-3U,  the MG-3U VELCRO for Velcro backed patches.  ','Merrow is acutely aware of the difficulties facing small businesses, so we make sure that we go beyond just giving them sewing machines.  We are unique in the sewing world in that we sew a sample of the customerâs material or product to give them exactly what they need to be competitive, frequently introducing new machine models and applications in the process.  Merrow has a legacy of innovation and invention and we want our customers to know that this extends beyond our iconic sewing machines.  It is the foundation of models like the MG-3U and our ability to create custom derivations from it that attract customers like Brightecâ¢ to Merrow.   We are unique in this regard and it is why Merrow can add value beyond great machines and emblematic stitching. If we have a machine that doesnât exactly fit a customerâs needs weâll adapt one of our 360 models to make it fit, typically coming up with something completely new in the process.

','Tim Hoffman, Owner Hoffman Custom Embroi','When Ramblers Way set out to sew their line of next-to-skin active wear, they contacted Merrow about sewing machines.  What they got was a comprehensive solution; a unique performance oriented panel stitch sewn on the MG-2DFS-2.  âWe sent them the material for the garments we were producing and they sewed it off with a stich that was perfect for our application. We told them what we wanted and they were able to deliver the stitch and machines within a matter of weeks.â   ','The Ramblers'' story is not unusual - it is how Merrow has been serving its customers since it introduced the first overlock sewing machine over 170 years ago. We were introduced to Ramblers through the factory that was producing their garments - the factory was having diffictulty sewing Ramblers'' superfine Rambouillet wool on their existing machines, so they brought us in to come up with a solution.  The result - a brand new production grade machine (the MG-2DFS-2) that is capable of handling Ramblerâs unique material.  The factory bought the machines, produced the garments, and Ramblers Way was able to go to market with unique garments that were sewn by unique machines.      ','We worked closely with the folks at Ramblers to make sure that their needs were met and in the end developed a new type of stitch that replaces the cover stitch.  The Merrow Panel Stitch sewn by the MG-2DFS-2 performs better and is more attractive than a traditional cover stitch, allowing Ramblers to promote the unique features of their garments.  Ramblers has moved well beyond their first production run, and the Merrowâs they initially bought continue to run flawlessy. ','At Merrow we know sewing machines and we care about stitching, and we  do everything in our power to make sure that our customers are putting the highest quality stitch on their garments.

When Tim learned of Merrow he knew he had found equipment that would meet his quality standards and also something that would give him an edge over his competitors in the greater Annapolis area. The Merrow MG-3U  would allow Hoffman Custom Embroidery to sew a custom Merrowed edge on the myriad of emblem shapes and sizes that are the norm with the local motorcycle and social clubs that make up a significant portion of Hoffman''s customer base. Merrow provided Tim an MG-3U bundled with a table and motor along with the correct Merrowing thread and Tim was up and running.','Even for a skilled guy like Tim there was a learning curve for the MG-3U. His mechanical skill and knowledge of technical equipment provided a foundation for Merrowing an edge, but when Tim discovered he needed more in-depth training Merrow was eager to help.
